# Machine-Learning
*my introduction to machine learning by doing, starting from the basics until understanding and implementing machine learning algorithms*
## 1. File 1 (1_Basics.ipynb) contains initiation to basic functions, declaration, definition of functions, conditional structures, for and while loops, lambda function
These are aspects that can be found in all programming languages (conditions, loop, declaration of variables, functions), this is the way of basic reasoning,
by understanding a small problem, and we think about the method we must use in order to achieve our goal
