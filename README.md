# Machine-Learning
*my introduction to machine learning by doing, starting from the basics until understanding and implementing machine learning algorithms*

## 1. File 1 (1_Basics.ipynb) 
- ### contains initiation to basic functions, declaration, definition of functions, conditional structures, for and while loops, lambda function
These are aspects that can be found in all programming languages (conditions, loop, declaration of variables, functions), this is the way of basic reasoning,
by understanding a small problem, and we think about the method we must use in order to achieve our goal

## 2. File 2 (2_DataStructure_Dictionary) 
- ### contains the basic data structures in python that will be used in machine  learning in general (data saving and manipulation)
it contains the lists, the tuples and the dictionaries as well as the methods which are used for the optimization of time and processor,
important point: comprehension list and comprehension dictionary which save time and do professional work

## 3. File 3 (3_Numpy) 
- ### contains the basics of using Numpy,
explains and practices basic numpy functions as well as some advanced functions,
much more use of matrices and manipulations of contanant data in the numpy matrices
